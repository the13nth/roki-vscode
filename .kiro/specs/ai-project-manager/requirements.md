# Requirements Document

## Introduction
This project, vbscc, aims to establish a fresh, meat-based pet food delivery service in Rwanda.  We will source high-quality meat, prepare customized meals based on pet dietary needs, and deliver directly to customers' homes via an online ordering system.  The system will ensure compliance with all relevant Rwandan regulations, including tax and data protection laws.
