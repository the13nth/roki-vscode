By centralizing purchasing and fostering a strong community, Pawsitive Power aims to reduce the cost of dog food, improve its quality, and provide a central hub for dog owners to connect and share information.\n\nThe target audience for Pawsitive Power is dog owners of all backgrounds who are interested in saving money on dog food without compromising quality.  These users need a convenient and transparent platform to access discounted products, compare brands, read reviews from other dog owners, and engage with a community of like-minded individuals.

Personalized recommendations and targeted promotions will enhance user engagement.  The platform will be designed to foster a sense of community, encouraging users to share their experiences and connect with other dog owners.
