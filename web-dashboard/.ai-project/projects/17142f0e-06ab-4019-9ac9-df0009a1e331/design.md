# Design Document

## Overview
DescribeOnce simplifies location sharing in Rwanda by allowing users to create precise location descriptions using landmarks.  This web application addresses the challenge of imprecise addresses by bridging the gap between formal street addresses and commonly used landmark-based directions. The application leverages a Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL, a React frontend with Material-UI, Firebase Authentication, and Google Cloud hosting.

## Architecture

### System Components

    Backend Service --> Firebase Auth
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend communicates with the backend API via API Gateway.
3. Backend interacts with the PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
4. Firebase Authentication handles user authentication.

## Components and Interfaces

### User Authentication
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
}
```

### Location Management
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Location {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  description: string;
  landmarks: string[];
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface Location {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  description: string;
  landmarks: string[];
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4-generated-id",
  "userId": "firebase-user-uid",
  "latitude": -1.9506,
  "longitude": 30.0619,
  "description": "Near Kigali Convention Centre, opposite the blue kiosk.",
  "landmarks": ["Kigali Convention Centre", "blue kiosk"]
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Authentication Errors:** Invalid credentials, account already exists, etc.
- **Database Errors:** Connection errors, data integrity violations, etc.
- **Location Errors:** Invalid coordinates, missing landmarks, etc.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Individual components and functions will be tested in isolation.

### Integration Testing
Interactions between different components and services will be tested.

### End-to-End Testing
User flows and complete scenarios will be tested.

### Manual Testing
Usability and visual aspects will be tested manually.
