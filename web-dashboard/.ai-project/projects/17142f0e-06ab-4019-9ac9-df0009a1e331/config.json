  "description": "DescribeOnce is a web application designed to simplify location sharing and navigation in Rwanda, addressing the challenge of imprecise addresses.  It bridges the gap between formal street addresses and commonly used landmark-based directions. Users can create and share precise location descriptions using familiar landmarks, eliminating the ambiguity of traditional address systems.  The application will allow users to save their home location and generate a shareable link or description that can be easily understood by anyone, regardless of their familiarity with the area. This improves communication and makes it easier for people to find locations, particularly in areas with less developed addressing infrastructure.\n\nThe target users are residents of Rwanda, visitors to Rwanda, delivery drivers, taxi drivers, and anyone needing to share or find a location within the country.  Users need a simple and reliable way to communicate location information, regardless of their technical expertise.  They require a platform that is accessible on various devices and integrates seamlessly with existing communication channels.  The application should be intuitive and easy to use, even for those unfamiliar with mapping technology.\n\nKey features include user registration and login, location saving and management,  landmark-based description generation, shareable links and descriptions via SMS or other messaging platforms, and an optional map integration for visual context. The application will also allow users to edit and update their saved locations as needed.  Future enhancements could include integration with popular ride-hailing and delivery services.\n\nThe technical requirements include a robust backend capable of handling location data and user authentication.  A responsive frontend framework will ensure accessibility across various devices.  The application will utilize a suitable UI framework to provide a user-friendly interface. Secure authentication is crucial to protect user data.  Hosting should be reliable and scalable to accommodate growing user demand.  Potential technologies include a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database, a React frontend, and JWT authentication. Hosting on a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud is recommended.\n\nUsers will interact with the application primarily through a web browser on their mobile devices or computers. The interface will be clean and intuitive, allowing users to easily input their location details using landmarks.  The generated descriptions will be concise and easy to understand, with the option to view the location on a map.  Sharing will be facilitated through integration with popular messaging platforms.  Success will be measured by user adoption rates, the number of shared locations, and positive user feedback.  Ultimately, the project's success hinges on its ability to simplify location sharing and improve navigation in Rwanda.",
