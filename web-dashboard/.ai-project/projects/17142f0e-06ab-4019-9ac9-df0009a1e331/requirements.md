# Requirements Document

## Introduction
DescribeOnce is a web application designed to simplify location sharing and navigation in Rwanda. It allows users to create precise location descriptions using familiar landmarks, bridging the gap between formal street addresses and common landmark-based directions.  This improves communication and makes it easier for people to find locations, particularly in areas with less developed addressing infrastructure. The target users are residents of Rwanda, visitors, delivery drivers, taxi drivers, and anyone needing to share or find a location within the country.
