# Design Document

## Overview
Kanda Assist is a web application designed to be a comprehensive solution for Rwandan drivers, providing roadside assistance, online insurance brokerage services, claim support, and access to a trusted marketplace for vehicle spare parts.  The application will leverage a modern technology stack including React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, Shadcn-UI for the UI framework, Firebase Authentication for user management, and Netlify for hosting.

## Architecture

### System Components

```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend communicates with the backend API gateway.
3. API gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices (e.g., Roadside Assistance, Insurance, Spare Parts).
4. Microservices interact with the database and third-party services.
5. Data is returned to the frontend for display to the user.

## Components and Interfaces

### Roadside Assistance Component
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface AssistanceRequest {
  userId: string;
  location: { latitude: number; longitude: number };
  vehicleType: string;
  problemDescription: string;
}
```

### Insurance Component
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface InsurancePolicy {
  provider: string;
  coverageType: string;
  price: number;
  details: string;
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
}

// JSON Example
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "+250788123456"
}
```

## Error Handling
- **Client-side errors:** Display user-friendly error messages.
- **Server-side errors:** Log errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Third-party API errors:** Implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components and functions in isolation.

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between different components and services.

### End-to-End Testing
- Test the entire application flow from user interaction to backend processing.

### Manual Testing
- Perform exploratory testing to identify usability issues and edge cases.
