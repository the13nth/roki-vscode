# Design Document

## Overview
Pawsitive Power is a web application that connects dog owners with each other and directly with dog food suppliers to leverage collective buying power. The application will be built using a Python Django backend, React frontend, Material UI for styling, Auth0 for authentication, and hosted on AWS.

## Architecture

### System Components

    Client --> API Gateway --> Django Backend
    Django Backend --> Database
    Django Backend --> Auth0
    Django Backend --> Payment Gateway
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend sends requests to the Django backend via the API Gateway.
3. Backend processes requests, interacts with the database, Auth0 for authentication, and payment gateway for transactions.
4. Backend sends responses back to the frontend.

## Components and Interfaces

### User Authentication
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  membershipTier: 'free' | 'premium';
}
```

### Product Catalog
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  brand: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  reviews: Review[];
}

interface Review {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  rating: number;
  comment: string;
}
```

## Data Models

### User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  membershipTier: 'free' | 'premium';
}
```
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "membershipTier": "premium"
}
```

### Product Model
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  brand: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  reviews: Review[];
}
```
```json
{
  "id": "456",
  "name": "Dog Food",
  "brand": "Acme",
  "description": "Best dog food ever",
  "price": 29.99,
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/dogfood.jpg",
  "reviews": []
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Authentication Errors:** Invalid credentials, account locked, etc.
- **Authorization Errors:** Insufficient permissions.
- **Data Validation Errors:** Invalid input data.
- **Payment Processing Errors:** Declined transactions.
- **Server Errors:** Internal server errors.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing:
Testing individual components and functions in isolation.

### Integration Testing:
Testing the interaction between different components.

### End-to-End Testing:
Testing the entire application flow from the user's perspective.

### Manual Testing:
Exploratory testing to identify usability issues and edge cases.
