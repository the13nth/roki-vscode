# Design Document

## Overview
Thomas is a web application designed to connect dog owners in Rwanda with local dog food producers and suppliers. It facilitates online ordering, delivery, and subscription services for affordable and reliable dog food. The application will be built using a modern technology stack including Next.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Firebase Authentication for user authentication, and Vercel for hosting.

## Architecture

### System Components

    Client --> API Gateway
    API Gateway --> Authentication (Firebase)
    API Gateway --> Backend Services (Node.js/Express)
    Backend Services --> Database
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the Next.js frontend.
2. Frontend sends requests to the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway authenticates requests using Firebase Authentication.
4. Authenticated requests are forwarded to the backend services.
5. Backend services interact with the database.
6. Data is returned to the frontend through the API Gateway.

## Components and Interfaces

### Product Catalog
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  supplier: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  stock: number;
}
```

### Order Management
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  products: { productId: string; quantity: number }[];
  deliveryAddress: string;
  orderDate: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'shipped' | 'delivered' | 'cancelled';
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  address?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
}
```

JSON Example:
```json
{
  "id": "user123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": "Kigali, Rwanda",
  "phoneNumber": "+250781234567"
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Authentication Errors:** Invalid credentials, account not found.
- **Authorization Errors:** Insufficient permissions.
- **Data Validation Errors:** Invalid input data.
- **Database Errors:** Connection errors, query errors.
- **Server Errors:** Internal server errors.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Individual components and functions will be tested using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Integration Testing
Interactions between different components and services will be tested.

### End-to-End Testing
User flows and scenarios will be tested using Cypress or similar tools.

### Manual Testing
Exploratory testing and usability testing will be performed.
