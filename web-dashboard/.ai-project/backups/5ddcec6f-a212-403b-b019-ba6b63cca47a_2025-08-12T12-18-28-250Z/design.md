# Design Document

## Overview
Snapshop is a mobile application that streamlines the process of purchasing everyday household items.  Users take a picture of a product, and the app identifies it, compares prices across retailers, and facilitates purchase and delivery. The app leverages image recognition, real-time data integration, and secure payment processing.  The technology stack includes React for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, Material-UI for the UI, Firebase Authentication, and Google Cloud for hosting.

## Architecture

### System Components

    MobileApp --> API Gateway
    API Gateway --> ImageRecognitionService
    API Gateway --> ProductDatabase
    API Gateway --> RetailerAPIs
    API Gateway --> OrderManagementService
    ImageRecognitionService --> ProductDatabase
    RetailerAPIs --> ProductDatabase
    OrderManagementService --> UserDatabase
```

### Data Flow
1. User takes a picture of a product.
2. Mobile app sends the image to the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway forwards the image to the Image Recognition Service.
4. Image Recognition Service identifies the product and returns the product ID.
5. API Gateway queries the Product Database for product details.
6. API Gateway queries Retailer APIs for price and availability.
7. API Gateway aggregates the data and sends it back to the mobile app.
8. User selects a retailer and proceeds to checkout.
9. API Gateway forwards the order details to the Order Management Service.
10. Order Management Service processes the order and updates the User Database.

## Components and Interfaces

### Image Recognition Service
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface ProductRecognitionResult {
  productId: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

### Product Database
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "name": "Milk",
  "category": "Dairy",
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/milk.jpg"
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Image Recognition Errors:** Invalid image format, product not found.
- **Retailer API Errors:** API connection issues, invalid data format.
- **Database Errors:** Connection errors, data integrity issues.
- **Payment Errors:** Insufficient funds, declined card.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Individual components and functions will be tested in isolation.

### Integration Testing
Interactions between different components and services will be tested.

### End-to-End Testing
The entire application flow, from taking a picture to completing an order, will be tested.

### Manual Testing
User interface and user experience will be tested manually.
