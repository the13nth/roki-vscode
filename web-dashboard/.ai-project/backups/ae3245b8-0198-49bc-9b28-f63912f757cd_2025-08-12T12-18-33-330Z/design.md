# Design Document

## Overview
Pawsitive Power will be a web-based platform built using a modern technology stack including TypeScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.  It will provide a user-friendly interface for dog owners to manage their memberships, browse and purchase dog food, interact with the community, and access partner services. The platform will also include a robust backend system for managing orders, inventory, and supplier relationships.

## Architecture

### System Components
```mermaid
graph LR
    Client --> API Gateway --> Authentication Service
    API Gateway --> Order Service
    API Gateway --> Product Service
    API Gateway --> Community Service
    API Gateway --> Partner Service
    Authentication Service --> User Database
    Order Service --> Order Database
    Product Service --> Product Database
    Community Service --> Community Database
    Partner Service --> Partner Database
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the client application (web or mobile).
2. Client sends requests to the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
4. Microservices interact with their respective databases.
5. Microservices return responses to the API Gateway.
6. API Gateway returns responses to the client.

## Components and Interfaces

### Authentication Service
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  dogInfo: Dog[];
}

interface Dog {
  name: string;
  breed: string;
  age: number;
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
}
```

### Product Service
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  brand: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  imageUrl: string;
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Client-side errors:** Invalid input, network issues.
- **Server-side errors:** Database errors, authentication failures, service unavailable.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Individual components and functions will be tested in isolation.

### Integration Testing
Interactions between different components and services will be tested.

### End-to-End Testing
The entire system will be tested from the user interface to the backend database.

### Manual Testing
User acceptance testing will be performed to ensure the platform meets user requirements.
