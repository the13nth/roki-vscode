  "description": "This project aims to develop a web application that facilitates fractional ownership of electric motorbikes in Rwanda, addressing the financial barrier to entry for individuals interested in this growing market.  The application will connect groups of up to 20 co-owners to collectively invest in an electric motorbike and manage its operation, including driver selection and dividend distribution.  The platform will handle the financial transactions, track income and expenses, and calculate individual returns for each co-owner.  This provides an opportunity for individuals with limited capital to participate in the lucrative motorbike taxi business and generate passive income, contributing to financial inclusion and economic empowerment.\n\nThe target users are Rwandan citizens with limited financial resources who are interested in investing in the motorbike taxi business. These users typically have an average monthly salary of around 90,000 RWF and cannot afford the upfront cost of a motorbike (approximately 2,000 USD).  The application must be user-friendly and accessible, considering varying levels of digital literacy.  Key features include user registration and profile management, group formation and management, motorbike registration and tracking, driver management, automated payment processing and dividend distribution, expense tracking, reporting and analytics on individual and group investments, and secure communication channels between co-owners and drivers.\n\nThe web application requires a robust and scalable backend to handle financial transactions, data management, and user authentication.  A modern frontend framework will ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.  Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial to protect user data and financial information.  The platform should be hosted on a reliable and secure cloud platform to ensure availability and data integrity.  Specific technologies will be selected based on performance, security, and scalability requirements, considering open-source options where appropriate.\n\nUsers will interact with the application through a web browser on their desktop or mobile devices.  The interface will be intuitive and easy to navigate, guiding users through the process of joining or creating investment groups, managing their investments, and tracking their returns.  Clear visualizations and reporting tools will provide users with insights into their investment performance.  Secure communication features will facilitate interaction between co-owners and drivers.\n\nThis project addresses the financial barrier preventing many Rwandans from participating in the profitable electric motorbike taxi market. By enabling fractional ownership, the application democratizes access to this investment opportunity, promoting financial inclusion and generating income for individuals.  The platform also contributes to the growth of the electric motorbike sector in Rwanda, aligning with the government's vision for sustainable transportation.  Success will be measured by the number of registered users, active investment groups, motorbikes financed through the platform, and the overall return on investment generated for co-owners.  Regular user feedback and satisfaction surveys will also be used to assess the platform's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.",
