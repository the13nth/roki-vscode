# Design Document

## Overview
MOGO is a web application that facilitates fractional ownership of electric motorbikes in Rwanda. It connects groups of up to 20 co-owners to collectively invest in and manage the operation of an electric motorbike, including driver selection and dividend distribution. The platform handles financial transactions, tracks income and expenses, and calculates individual returns.  The application will be built using a modern technology stack including React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, Material-UI for the UI framework, Firebase Authentication for user authentication, and Netlify for hosting.

```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend sends requests to the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway routes requests to appropriate backend services.
4. Backend services interact with the database, Firebase Auth, and payment gateway.
5. Backend services return responses to the frontend via the API Gateway.
6. Frontend renders the data and updates the UI.

## Components and Interfaces

### User Management
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  investmentGroups: string[];
}
```

### Group Management
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Group {
  groupId: string;
  admin: string;
  members: string[];
  motorbike: string;
  expenses: Expense[];
  income: number;
}
```

### Motorbike Management
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface Motorbike {
  motorbikeId: string;
  registrationNumber: string;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  currentDriver: string;
  location: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  investmentGroups: string[];
}

// Example JSON
{
  "uid": "xyz123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "+250781234567",
  "investmentGroups": ["group123", "group456"]
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Authentication Errors:** Invalid credentials, account not found.
- **Authorization Errors:** Insufficient permissions.
- **Data Validation Errors:** Invalid input data.
- **Database Errors:** Connection errors, query errors.
- **Payment Gateway Errors:** Transaction failures.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing:
Testing individual components and functions in isolation.

### Integration Testing:
Testing the interaction between different components and modules.

### End-to-End Testing:
Testing the entire application flow from the user interface to the backend.

### Manual Testing:
User acceptance testing to ensure usability and functionality.
