# Design Document

## Overview
The rottie project aims to develop an intent-based mobile launcher using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, Material-UI for the UI framework, and Firebase Authentication for user authentication.  This launcher will interpret user intentions expressed through natural language and provide contextually relevant actions and information.  The system will leverage NLP, a knowledge graph, and a behavioral analysis engine to personalize the user experience.

## Architecture

### System Components
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Interface (React)] --> B(API Gateway (Node.js/Express))
    B --> C{Intent Recognition (NLP Engine)}
    C --> D[Knowledge Graph]
    D --> E[Action & Content Retrieval]
    E --> B
    B --> A
    F[Behavioral Analysis Engine] --> D
    A --> F
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Request is sent to the Node.js/Express API gateway.
3. API gateway forwards the request to the NLP engine for intent recognition.
4. NLP engine extracts the intent and queries the knowledge graph.
5. Knowledge graph retrieves relevant actions and content.
6. Results are returned to the user interface.
7. User interactions are tracked and fed into the behavioral analysis engine.
8. Behavioral analysis engine updates the knowledge graph and personalization models.

## Components and Interfaces

### User Interface
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface UserIntent {
  intent: string;
  parameters: { [key: string]: any };
}

interface ActionResult {
  actionType: string;
  data: any;
}
```

### API Gateway
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface APIRequest {
  intent: string;
  context: {
    location: string;
    time: string;
  };
}

interface APIResponse {
  results: ActionResult[];
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface IntentData {
  name: string;
  keywords: string[];
  actions: string[];
}
```

JSON Example:
```json
{
  "name": "playMusic",
  "keywords": ["play", "music", "song"],
  "actions": ["openSpotify", "openAppleMusic"]
}
```

## Error Handling

- **NLP Errors:** Invalid input, ambiguous intent.
- **Knowledge Graph Errors:** No matching actions, data retrieval failure.
- **API Errors:** Network issues, server errors.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing:
Testing individual components and functions in isolation.

### Integration Testing:
Testing the interaction between different components.

### End-to-End Testing:
Testing the entire system flow from user input to result display.

### Manual Testing:
User acceptance testing to validate usability and functionality.
