# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The rottie project aims to create an intent-based mobile launcher that simplifies user interaction by focusing on goals rather than apps. Users express their intentions through natural language or other input methods, and the launcher intelligently surfaces relevant actions and content. This project targets all smartphone users seeking a more streamlined and efficient mobile experience, ultimately enhancing productivity and reducing cognitive load.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language Input
**User Story:** As a user, I want to express my intentions using natural language, so that I can quickly access relevant information and actions without navigating through multiple apps.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user inputs a natural language query, THEN the system should process the query and identify the user's intent.
2. WHEN the intent is identified, THEN the system should present relevant actions, content, and suggestions.
3. IF the system cannot understand the query, THEN it should provide helpful feedback and alternative input options.

### Requirement 2: Context-Aware Intelligence
**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to be context-aware, so that it can provide relevant information and actions based on my current time, location, and usage patterns.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user's location changes, THEN the launcher should update location-based suggestions (e.g., nearby restaurants).
2. WHEN the time of day changes, THEN the launcher should offer relevant time-sensitive information (e.g., upcoming calendar events).
3. IF the user frequently performs certain actions, THEN the launcher should prioritize those actions in future suggestions.

### Requirement 3: Action-Oriented Results
**User Story:** As a user, I want the results to be action-oriented, so that I can directly perform actions without navigating through multiple screens.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user searches for something, THEN the results should include direct actions (e.g., "Call John Doe", "Send email to Jane Doe").
2. WHEN relevant content is available, THEN the results should include previews and links to access the content.
3. IF multiple actions are possible, THEN the launcher should offer alternative paths to achieve the desired outcome.

### Requirement 4: Personalized Learning
**User Story:** As a user, I want the launcher to learn my preferences over time, so that it can provide more personalized and relevant suggestions.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user interacts with the launcher, THEN the system should track user behavior and preferences.
2. WHEN sufficient data is collected, THEN the launcher should personalize suggestions based on the user's past actions.
3. IF the user provides explicit feedback, THEN the system should incorporate that feedback into the learning process.

### Requirement 5: Privacy Preservation
**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be handled responsibly, so that my privacy is protected.
#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing user data, THEN the system should prioritize on-device processing whenever possible.
2. IF data needs to be shared, THEN it should be anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy.
3. WHEN using federated learning, THEN the system should ensure that sensitive data remains on the user's device.
