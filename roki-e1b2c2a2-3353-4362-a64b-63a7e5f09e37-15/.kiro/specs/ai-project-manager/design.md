# Design Document

## Overview
This project enhances an existing AI-powered project management web application with business development features. The technology stack includes Node.js (Express.js) for the backend, React with Material-UI for the frontend, JWT for authentication, and AWS for hosting.  The existing AI capabilities will be enhanced to provide business intelligence.

## Architecture

### System Components
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Frontend (React)] --> B(API Gateway);
    B --> C[Backend (Node.js)];
    C --> D{Database};
    C --> E[AI Engine];
    A --> F[Market Research APIs];
    F --> B;
    A --> G[Third-Party Services];
    G --> B;
```

### Data Flow
1. The user interacts with the React frontend.
2. User requests are sent to the API Gateway.
3. The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate backend services.
4. The backend interacts with the database for data persistence.
5. The AI engine processes data and provides insights.
6. Data from external APIs and services are integrated.
7. Responses are sent back to the frontend for display.

## Components and Interfaces

### Business Model Canvas Component
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface BusinessModelCanvas {
  valuePropositions: string[];
  customerSegments: string[];
  customerRelationships: string[];
  channels: string[];
  revenueStreams: string[];
  keyActivities: string[];
  keyResources: string[];
  keyPartnerships: string[];
  costStructure: string[];
}
```

### Market Research Component
**Key Components:**
```typescript
interface MarketResearchData {
  marketSize: number;
  growthRate: number;
  competitors: Competitor[];
}

interface Competitor {
  name: string;
  marketShare: number;
  strengths: string[];
  weaknesses: string[];
}
```

## Data Models

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: string;
}

interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  businessModelCanvas: BusinessModelCanvas | null;
  marketResearch: MarketResearchData | null;
  // ... other project details
}
```

Example JSON for Project:
{"id": "123", "name": "Roki Project", "description": "AI-powered project management", "businessModelCanvas": {"valuePropositions": ["\"Improve project success rates\""], "customerSegments": ["\"Entrepreneurs\"", "\"Product Managers\""], "customerRelationships": ["\"Self-service\""], "channels": ["\"Web Application\""], "revenueStreams": ["\"Subscription fees\""], "keyActivities": ["\"Software Development\""], "keyResources": ["\"AI algorithms\""], "keyPartnerships": ["\"AWS\""], "costStructure": ["\"Development costs\""]}, "marketResearch": {"marketSize": 1000000, "growthRate": 0.1, "competitors": [{"name": "\"Competitor A\"", "marketShare": 0.2, "strengths": ["\"Brand recognition\""], "weaknesses": ["\"High pricing\""]}]}

## Error Handling
- **Authentication Errors:** JWT token invalid, expired, or missing.
- **Database Errors:** Connection errors, data integrity violations.
- **API Errors:**  External API request failures, rate limits exceeded.
- **Business Logic Errors:** Invalid input data, conflicting requirements.

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Testing:  Testing individual components and functions using Jest and appropriate mocking.
### Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between different components and services.
### End-to-End Testing: Testing the entire application flow from user interaction to database persistence.
### Manual Testing: User acceptance testing to ensure usability and functionality.
