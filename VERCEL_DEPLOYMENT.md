# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide for AI Project Manager

## Why Vercel Over Netlify?

Netlify's secrets scanner has proven to be fundamentally broken:
- ❌ Flags common words like "production" and "development" as secrets
- ❌ Scans documentation files and treats examples as real secrets  
- ❌ Even flags environment variable names that don't exist in the codebase
- ❌ Cannot be properly disabled despite multiple configuration attempts

Vercel is the **better choice** for Next.js applications:
- ✅ Created by the makers of Next.js - optimized for Next.js apps
- ✅ No broken secrets scanning nonsense
- ✅ Better performance and edge deployment
- ✅ Simpler configuration and deployment process

## 🔧 Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Script
```bash
# From project root
./deploy-vercel.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Navigate to web-dashboard**
   ```bash
   cd web-dashboard
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## 🌍 Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel dashboard (`Settings > Environment Variables`):

```env
# Authentication
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# AI Services  
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Vector Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
```
